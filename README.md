# PokerGame App
PokerGame App is a poker game designed for social play between friends. It allows poker games to be played where iPads act as the "table" and iPhones serve as individual hands for each player. All devices are connected via a local network (Wi-Fi), providing a smooth and intuitive poker experience without the need for physical cards.

iPad serves as the central "table" displaying the game’s progress.
Players use iPhones to hold their hands and manage their chips.
Minimalist UI to replicate the atmosphere of a real poker table.
Supports Texas Hold'em poker.
